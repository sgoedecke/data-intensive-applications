### Chapter 1: Reliable, Scalable and Maintainable Applications

What is a “data system”? A database, queue, cache - anything that you write data to and read data from. In fact, when you plug together a database, queue, cache, and server into a standard web service, you’re building a distributed data system from general purpose components.

This book is interested in maximising some combination of _reliability_, _scalability_, and _maintainability_. Reliability is about tolerating faults (hardware, software, and human) without creating failures. Scalability is about handling load while keeping latency and response time acceptable. Maintainability is about extensibility and operability.
